# 2023_Moravia_mowing
Our study aims to assess the effects of long-term mosaic mowing, low-intensity mowing and regular mowing on plant diversity in semi-dry grasslands of South Moravia.

## Ideas

* Grid of boxplots:
  - Species richness
  - Number of endangered species
  - Diversity index (to show uneven communities)
  - Ecological Indicator Values to test for mesophilization and nutrification

* Multivariate model:
  - species ~ mowing, displaying species. Subset 1:1 set of data to have correct comparison.
  - species ~ mowing * mosaic (problem with mosaics unbalanced dataset - too little mosaics from Dáša's area)
