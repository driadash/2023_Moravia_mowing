v.230823 - All raw data merged.

seceni-headers - header data
Plot IDs added to all plots and sites.

seceni-releves - vegetation plots
Nomenclature not harmonised. 
Woody species in different layers (S, H, juv., seedl) - possibly shrub layer was considered differently in different datasets (DB - shrub layer >50 cm)

Before using releve data: 
remove 10 m2 plots (area = "10"); 
remove 'subplot' (needed just when using 10 m2 and 25 m2);
remove 'comment' (remarks on plants in herbarium)
